# French Football Corporation AI Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on optimizing the positioning strategy for the French Football Corporation. The goal is to recommend positions for the goal keeper to kick the ball, allowing the French team's players to subsequently hit it with their heads. The project primarily explores the effects of different regularization techniques, namely L2 and Dropout, implemented using neural networks built from scratch using NumPy and SciPy libraries in Python.

## Project Structure

- `datasets/`: Folder containing the datasets used for training and testing the neural network.
- `reg_utils.py`: Utility functions for regularization techniques such as L2 and Dropout.
- `French_Football_AI_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code implementation, analysis, and visualization.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SherryS997/French-Football-AI-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Open and run the `French_Football_AI_Analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook in an environment with the required dependencies installed.

## Results

The analysis highlights the impact of L2 regularization and Dropout techniques on the neural network's performance, providing insights into optimal strategies for the French Football Corporation.
